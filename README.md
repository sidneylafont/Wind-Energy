# Analyzing Energy Generated from Wind as a Result of Time of Day and Environmental Factors

For this project our goal was to gather weather data from a certain area, and determine the power that would be generated for a type of wind turbine from a variety of factors. We scraped data from NOAA on temperature, air pressure, wind speed, wind direction, and time of day. We then adjusted our data so that it was in terms of the correct units and used the different factors to calculate the Power Generated in watts. For our hypothesis test, we looked specifically at whether the time of day (early morning, mid morning, afternoon or night) affected the amount of power generated, and the results of our ANOVA test provided evidence supporting a relationship between the two. We then used a predictive supervised regression model to predict the amount of power generated based on our features. Using feature selection, we ended up using only wind direction, wind speed and air pressure to make these predictions, and found that our training and testing data produced similar results, and when evaluating our models, we found that linear regression, Ridge, and Lasso algorithms revealed the best performance and are the ones that should be used for our predictive model.
