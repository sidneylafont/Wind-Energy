    "Problem Statement:\n",
    "    I would like to address the misinformation that is spreading about how impractical wind turbines are as a legitimate energy source that the United States could rely upon. Too often in conversations about green energy sources that could significantly help ease the United States' over-reliance on fossil fuels and coal, wind energy is dismissed as not efficient enough because turbines cannot convert wind into electricity at a perfect 100 percent efficiency. Yet the amount of actual electricity a wind turbine can produce is never mentioned. I plan to use data collected about the weather in a few areas in the United States and convert it into the watts that could potentially be produced by a wind turbine in that area. I can find data on the weather across the United States from a multitude of different sources but I will most likely get data from NOAA (National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration) about temperature, wind speed, air density, and air pressure.\n",
    "    \n",
    "Significance of the Problem:\n",
    "    This project is important because it will show how much electricity can actually be generated by wind turbines in real areas of the United States. This can be used as another piece of evidence in favor of building more wind turbines to lessen the United Statesâ€™ dependence on harmful sources of electricity such as fossil fuels and coal, which wreak havoc on our atmosphere and have been a major contributing factor in global warming.\n",
    "    \n",
    "Questions:\n",
    "\tWhen we started we knew we wanted to ask questions about power produced from wind, but we did not specifically know what we wanted to ask, so below are some of the many questions we considered asking as our hypothesis, and some questions we wanted to answer separately from our hypothesis.\n",
    "    \n",
    "1.\tWould wind power be practical to power a small town?\n",
    "2.\tHow much land would it take to power a city using wind turbines, for example New York City?\n",
    "3.\tWould there be a difference in cost for a person/small business to buy, install, and maintain a wind turbine or buy electricity from an electrical company?\n",
    "4.\tWhat is the cost to carbon footprint ratio difference in using only wind turbines versus what we currently use to generate electricity?\n",
    "5.\tWhat machine learning algorithm would be most effective at predicting the weather based upon our features?\n",
    "\n",
    "Hypothesis:\n",
    "\n",
    "Null Hypothesis: \n",
    "There is no difference in amount of energy produced from wind turbines based on time of day.\n",
    "\n",
    "Alternate Hypothesis:\n",
    "There is a difference in amount of energy produced from wind turbines based on time of day."
